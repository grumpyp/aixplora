## How AI Can Revolutionize Customer Support for Small Businesses

In today's fast-paced world, customer support plays a crucial role in the success of any business, big or small. But for small businesses with limited resources, providing efficient and effective customer support can be a challenging task. This is where the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Language Model (LLM) and embeddings, comes into play, offering innovative solutions to streamline customer support processes.

Moreover, small businesses may lack the resources to invest in advanced customer support technologies.
