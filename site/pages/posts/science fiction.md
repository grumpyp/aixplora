## How AI Can Revolutionize Customer Support for Small Businesses

In today's fast-paced world, customer support plays a crucial role in the success of any business, big or small. But for small businesses with limited resources, providing efficient and effective customer support can be a challenging task. This is where the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Language Model (LLM) and embeddings, comes into play, offering innovative solutions to streamline customer support processes.
