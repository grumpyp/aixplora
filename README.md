AIxplora is your new personal assistant, an open-source project that opens up unlimited possibilities.
It leverages AI and LLMs to understand all types of documents, unrestricted by their length or format.

**Imagine being able to query PDF files, MP3 audio, videos, and other types of documents with equal ease and proficiency. 
Yes, that's the limitless world AIxplora is inviting you into!***

*Currently in our PoC version 0.0.1 only .pdf files are supported. We are releasing new file-types and features soon!
