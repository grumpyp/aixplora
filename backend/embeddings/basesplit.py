class BaseSplit(ABC):
    """
    Base class for splitting text into chunks.

    This class provides a base implementation for splitting text into reasonable chunks based on the `text_length`.
    It is an abstract base class (ABC) and should be subclassed to provide concrete implementations.

    Attributes:
        text (str): The input text to be split into chunks.
        context_type (ContextTypes): The context type for the text.
        text_length (Callable[[str], int]): A callable function to determine the length of the text.

    Methods:
        split(): Abstract method to split the text into chunks.
        
        chunk_document(): Abstract method to perform document chunking.

    Example Usage:
    ```
        class MySplitter(BaseSplit):
            def split(self) -> List[str]:
                # Implement the split logic here

            def chunk_document(self):
